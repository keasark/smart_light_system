## Introduction
In general, the growing demand for electric energy and inefficiencies in existing lighting
systems contribute significantly to economic and environmental challenges, particularly in states
like Texas where energy costs and consumption rates are well above the national average. This
burden is borne largely by low- to moderate-income households, especially renters, who face
higher utility costs relative to their incomes. Addressing these issues through improved energy
efficiency and targeted policy measures is critical to alleviating financial stress and promoting a
more sustainable and equitable energy future.

## Problem Statement
This project aims to develop an affordable, standalone smart lighting system specifically
designed for Texas renters, addressing the challenges of excessive energy consumption and high
electricity bills, while providing a user-friendly, easy-to-install solution that fits within tenancy
conditions and minimizes the risks associated with connecting technology in shared settings.

## Recommendation
With our portable design, we offer an affordable solution ideal for households, especially
renters, with easy, non-invasive installation and minimal setup. This simple yet highly accurate
design also helps renters reduce their energy bills, while providing a cost-effective and
technically safe alternative to more expensive, technically vulnerable high-end lighting solutions
on the market.
The aim of this solution is to significantly reduce residential electricity consumption by
optimizing the use of lighting. By implementing this smart system, tenants can effectively reduce
energy costs while contributing to environmental sustainability. The solution supports broader
initiatives focused on energy efficiency and ecological responsibility, providing a modern
approach to energy management in residential environments.

## Executive Summary
### Purpose of Project
The Energy Efficient Lighting Project was designed and implemented to meet the
growing energy efficiency needs of Texas’ approximately 4 million renters, nearly 90% of whom
are cost-burdened. Under lease agreements, tenants are typically not allowed to make interior
changes to their homes without the landlord’s permission and incur additional costs.
Additionally, similar products from competitors that incorporate advanced technology are often
at high risk of being hacked and invading privacy. Therefore, this safe, affordable, and
non-invasive lighting design that incorporates both PIR and ultrasonic technology with high
accuracy will meet the enormous needs of Texas’ large number of renters.
### Method
An in-depth research about the technology theories were conducted with information
gathered from academic sources, such as peer-reviewed articles. In addition, detailed data about
the rental unit is carefully collected from reliable sources into the calculation to increase the
practicality of the design. We then designed and tested multiple electrical models with different
components and coding programs to find the most efficient design on Tinkercad simulation.
Finally, we assembled the necessary components to build a visual and dynamic prototype.
### Evaluation and Conclusion
PIR sensors are good for detecting motion, while they do not work with static objects. In
addition, our affordable PIR sensors have a limited adjustment range. On the contrary, ultrasonic
sensors can detect static objects effectively. With the help of potentiometers, we can freely adjust
the detection range of ultrasonic sensors to suit the average room size of most tenants. This
integration creates the perfect human detection device with high accuracy at low cost to serve the
target consumer - Texas renters well.
